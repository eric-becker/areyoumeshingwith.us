# AreYouMeshingWith.us
Florida Mesh - https://AreYouMeshingWith.us/ website

## Architecture

The infrastructure to support the site is deployed via Terraform Infrastructure as Code in the [terrform/](terrform/) directory.

This is handled by the GitHub Actions workflow by PR comment of the Terraform Plan and execution of Terraform apply on merge with the `main` branch.

The current deployment is using AWS Cloudfront CDN with ACM certificate in front of an S3 bucket. All related DNS records are handled by Route53.

## Website

The website is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static HTML generator that is then deployed into the infrastructure managed via Terraform. The [HB Framework](https://hbstack.dev/) used for the theme layout requires the Hugo extended version along with additional build tools. If you want to run a local dev server to test you will need the [build tool](https://hbstack.dev/docs/getting-started/prerequisites/#build-tools) installed.

### Local dev

With the prerequisite build tools installed you can run a local dev server to work on you can proceed with the following workflow

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

This will run a [local webserver](http://localhost:1313/) that you can connect to and view your work.

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute, fork this repository and work on your content changes/updates. When you are satisfied submit your PR back to this repository to have it included.

The most common `Hugo` command you'll need to understand will be [hugo new content](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_new_content/) as most of the site configuration and theming will not need to be modified. It is benefitial to understand the `Hugo` [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) to better understand how things work together.
